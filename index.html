<h1> Hello, Team! </h1> </br> 
	
  <p> As we start getting familiar with GitHub, I wanted to pass along some quick and easy resources I've come across in the past few days!</p>
  
  <p> A few initial/helpful links: </p> 
  
	<p> <strong> Resources for Getting Started on GitHub </strong> </p>	
  <ul>  
    <li> <a href='http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/'> The easiest intro I've found so far </a> </li> 
    <li> <a href='https://guides.github.com/features/pages/'> GitHub's "Getting Started" Page </a> </li>
    <li> <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'> Jekyll Homepage (GitHub websites run with Jekyll. I'm still trying to figure out the when/why/how of using it (especially because it's not clear if you actually need to download anything to use it)</a></li>	  
  </ul>
		
	<p><strong> General Resources on HTML, Markdown, and USWDS </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'> Mozilla Developer's Network (MDN): HTML (One of the best references for HTML) </a></li>
    <li> <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference'> MDN on CSS (even though you should just use USWDS, is good to have this as well) </a></li>
    <li> <a href='https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/'>USWDS Documentation </a></li>	  
    <li> <a href='https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet'> Markdown Cheatsheet (GitHub likes to use markdown instead of HTML. It's a little easier, but more abstract) </a></li>
  </ul>

   <p> I strongly recomend downloading/using <a href='https://atom.io/'> Atom Editor </a> to write your code and then copying it into GitHub after the fact. Not only will Atom help you spot errorrs in your code before it's live, but it'll also let allow you to view the output locally before you put it online. Additionally, you should familiarize yourself with the Developer's tools available in <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools'>Firefox</a> or <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/'> Chrome </a>, as they'll prove invaluable for solving coding problems along the way (though this is most useful if using scripts, can also help spot issues with HTML).</p>
